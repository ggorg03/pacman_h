# pacman_h
This is an attempt to make a game similar to pacman
This is an example of how not to make a game in Ruby, this game will be done using the hyperactive and not object-oriented paradigm and as Ruby this is a mistake
I'm doing it this way because I'm a beginner and it's a good exercise for me
I promise, I will do this after with OO paradigm when I learn it
